# Data Science in Earth Observation - Regression

## Helmholtz AI CountMeIn Challenge


## Getting Started

To get started from scratch, please follow the steps:

1. Check that you have `python` installed in your system. Open a terminal (*power shell* in Windows), and then type:

```
python --version
```

You should see something like `Python 3.6.9`. This tutorial requires `python >= 3.6`. If you don't have python installed, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and follow the instructions.

2. Get the code `git clone git@github.com:acamero/data-science-eo-regression.git`, and go to the new folder (e.g., `cd data-science-eo-regression`).

3. Download the data from this (link)[https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiELMVZd49ezrL4ZjKAvciPm/], and copy it to the folder `data-science-eo-regression/data`.

4. [Recommended] Create a virtual environment `virutalenv --python=python3.6 venv`), and activate it `source venv/bin/activate`.

5. Install *Jupyterlab* `pip install jupyterlab`, and start it `jupyter-lab`.

6. Open the *notebook* `population_estimation.ipynb`, and follow the instructions.

**Note**: Please, be sure to complete steps 1 to 5 before the lecture, and to install all the required packages, either by running the first block of code of the notebook or by executing `pip install -r requirements`. Then, check that everything is ready by running `python check.py`. If the required packages are installed and the data is in place, you will get an `OK`.
